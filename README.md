## Basic Configuration

To use this app you need to setup configuration file. Here the step for use this app.


- Setup database on ```config.yaml```

```yaml
db_host : "YOUR MYSQL HOST" {Optional}
db_port : "YOUR MYSQL PORT" {Usually 3306}
db_name : "YOUR DATABASE NAME"
db_username : "YOUR DATABASE USERNAME"
db_password : "YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD" {Optional}
```
- Setup file path on ```config.yaml```
```yaml
current_path : "/public/assets/images"
destination_path : "YOUR DESTINATION PATH"
```
You can change the current path without paste the root path. You just
need to change the current path into your path that you make on the app.

## Custom Configuration
We know that your table structure not exactly same with me.
So here the things, how to custom the mysql table structure

- Declaring model on ```app/entity/model/product.go```
```go
type TableName struct{
ColumnName     data_type  `json:"column_name"`
}
```

Or you can make your own model.

- Change model on ```app/services/file/file.go```
```go
var testingModel = model.ProductModels{
ColumnName = Value			
}
```
